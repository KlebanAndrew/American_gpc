The American Green Power Corporation is at the forefront of leading technology behind microinverter systems and solar panel technology. 
Designed and manufactured by former NASA engineers in Silicon Valley, our system employs the most advanced microinverter and monitoring solution available 
in today's market. By harnessing the power of the industry's most robust power line communication system, coupled with innovative single processing techniques, 
local monitoring of the solar distribution panel is no longer necessary. Instead, the panel can now be monitored remotely using our USA-made gateway software 
that enables the customer to connect via residential electric outlets and internet connectivity. Moreover, this software can serve a dual purpose by integrating 
home security monitoring capabilities, providing a single, streamlined mechanism for all home energy and security monitoring needs. Unlike traditional solar 
panel inverters that are guaranteed for 5-10 years, our microinverter systems include a 25 year warrantee, thus providing a highly durable energy and security solution.
